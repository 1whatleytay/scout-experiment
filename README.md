# scout - N64 emulator experiment

Scout was an attempt to get a working N64 emulator.
I learned a bit about the N64 cpu and developed a better way to form an emulator infrastructure since Nem.
Although this project didn't get far and I moved onto other project, I am still happy with how this project turned out.
